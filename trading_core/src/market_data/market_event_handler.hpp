/*
    MarketEventHandler is the application-level consumer of MarketEvent.

    It receives MarketEvent instances produced by BookBuilder and forwards
    them to the components interested in market-data events.

    Data Flow:

        Exchange
           |
           v
        MarketDataSource
           |
           v
        MarketDataMessageHandler
           |
           v
        MarketDataParser
           |
           | BookUpdate
           v
        BookBuilder
           |
           | MarketEvent
           v
        MarketEventHandler
           |
           +----------------------+
           |                      |
           v                      v
        Strategy              Recorder

    Responsibilities:

        - receive MarketEvent from BookBuilder;
        - forward MarketEvent to the strategy;
        - forward MarketEvent to the recorder.

    MarketEventHandler does not:

        - create MarketEvent;
        - modify OrderBook;
        - generate trading signals;
        - perform risk validation;
        - manage orders;
        - manage positions;
        - calculate PnL.

    The IMarketEventHandler interface defines the contract used by BookBuilder.
    MarketEventHandler provides the concrete implementation of that contract.
